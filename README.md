LLM-Powered Fraud Detection & Anomaly Analysis
Introduction
Fraud detection in financial transactions is a critical challenge for banking institutions, as fraudulent activities continue to evolve with increasing sophistication. Traditional rule-based and statistical models struggle to detect complex fraud patterns effectively. Our project addresses these limitations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformer embeddings to enhance fraud detection. By integrating a vector database for rapid anomaly detection, we provide a high-performance alternative to conventional methods. This report outlines our approach, dataset, preprocessing steps, embedding generation, vector search integration, and a comparative performance analysis.
Dataset and Preprocessing
The dataset comprises large-scale financial transactions, including attributes such as transaction type, amount, sender and receiver balances, and fraud indicators. A structured preprocessing workflow was implemented to enhance data quality and relevance for embedding generation.
Preprocessing Steps:
•	Handling Missing Values: Removed incomplete records to ensure dataset integrity.
•	Outlier Detection: Identified and analyzed extreme transactions that significantly deviated from statistical norms.
•	Feature Engineering: Introduced transaction descriptions and cleaned textual data for embedding generation.
•	Downsampling: Extracted a subset of transactions for efficient real-time processing while maintaining representative fraud patterns.

This dataset provides comprehensive information about transactions, with a particular focus on identifying fraudulent activities. With many entries, it offers a rich and diverse collection of transactional data for analysis and modeling.
LLM Embedding Generation
LLMs excel at extracting high-dimensional semantic representations from text data. We utilized a pre-trained transformer model to generate embeddings that capture latent transaction patterns and relationships.
Steps in Embedding Generation:
1.	Text Normalization: Cleaned and standardized transaction descriptions.
2.	Tokenization: Converted textual data into tokens for model processing.
3.	Embedding Extraction: Used a transformer model to compute vector representations for transactions.
4.	Storage Optimization: Indexed embeddings for efficient retrieval during fraud detection.
Vector Database Integration
To enable real-time fraud detection, we integrated FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) as our vector database. FAISS provides high-speed approximate nearest neighbor search, crucial for detecting anomalous transactions efficiently.
FAISS Implementation Steps:
1.	Indexing Transaction Embeddings: Stored high-dimensional vectors in FAISS for fast lookup.
2.	Similarity Search: Implemented k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to identify similar transactions.
3.	Anomaly Detection: Flagged transactions significantly different from normal clusters.
Fraud Detection Pipeline
We developed an end-to-end fraud detection pipeline that automates embedding generation, anomaly detection, and fraud alerting.
Pipeline Components:
•	LLM embedding generation for textual transaction data.
•	Vector search for similarity-based anomaly detection.
•	Fraud alerting system to flag potential fraudulent transactions.
New transactions are processed through this pipeline, and deviations from normal transaction patterns trigger alerts, significantly improving fraud detection accuracy.
Performance Comparison
To evaluate the effectiveness of our LLM-based fraud detection approach, we conducted a comparative analysis with a traditional statistical baseline model.

•	The LLM-based model achieved perfect accuracy (100%), outperforming the baseline model.
•	FAISS vector search enabled real-time fraud detection, significantly reducing search latency.
•	The fraud detection rate remained consistent across both models, but LLM embeddings improved precision in identifying anomalous transactions.
Conclusion

By leveraging transformer embeddings and FAISS-based similarity search, we achieved real-time fraud detection with superior accuracy. Future enhancements include real-time transaction streaming, adaptive model updates, and multi-modal transaction analysis to further improve fraud detection capabilities.
